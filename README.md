# vanilla-weather

i followed this youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPElVpR1rwA

darksky.net weather api isn't open anymore, I used the weatherbit.io api. 

For letting the application run locally and going around the cors issue, i used nodes http-server.
i got that information from stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6084360/using-node-js-as-a-simple-web-server

for the icons skycon is used: https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/
